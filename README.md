# A simple budgeting program in which users can add categories based on their own spending habits. They can make deposits and withdrawals in each category, check the funds of each category and transfer funds between categories. Users can also print out a bar chart of their custom categories which displays the percentage of their spending in each category. This program was produced as part of the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp.org. Created by Jacob Hexamer.
